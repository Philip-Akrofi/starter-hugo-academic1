  In this study, we examine the impact of electricity power disruptions on the
  performance

  of Ghanaian enterprises. We make use of comprehensive firm-level data from

  the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) in the years 2007 and 2013 to ascertain

  the extent to which sales generation and firm-level productivity are affected by

  power outages. The cross-sectional nature of the data limits our analysis and makes

  fixed-effects estimation unfeasible; consequently, we generate a firm cohort identification

  (cohort ID) to serve as a pseudo firm fixed-effects element to obtain a more

  robust result. The findings show that power outages negatively affect firm performance;

  specifically, the sales growth and productivity of Ghanaian firms. The magnitude

  of negative impact is higher among manufacturing firms compared to firms in

  the service sector. Furthermore, firms that do not resort to a backup electricity generation

  plan are highly affected than firms that adopt other forms of electricity generation.

  Firms that possess backup electricity generators are, however, not completely

  immune from the negative impact of erratic power supply. The findings suggest that

  backup electricity generation isn’t a sustainable alternative, hence, the improvement

  of national electricity generation would be significant to firms’ performance.
