abstract: This paper adopts a micro-level analysis to assess the effect of aid
  from China and the World Bank on the wealth of locals residing near aid
  project sites. We match geospatial data on aid projects financed by China and
  the World Bank in 35 African countries between 2008 and 2014 to respondents
  from rounds 5 and 6 of the Afrobarometer survey. The results indicate that aid
  from these two donors increases the wealth of the local population. Our
  transmission mechanism test suggests that aid impacts wealth by promoting
  employment opportunities.
