abstract: This paper assesses the impact of Chinese foreign direct investment
  (FDI) on welfare in African economies using recently available data on Chinese
  FDI in 52 African countries between 2003 and 2018. Using fixed effects and
  instrumental variable (IV) estimations, we find that Chinese FDI contributes
  significantly to the improvement of welfare in African countries. This
  positive impact also holds for the sub-sample of Sub-Saharan African (SSA)
  countries. The results are robust across the fixed effects and IV estimations
  when variables that affect welfare are controlled for. The findings suggest
  that China’s claim of a “win-win” aim for its rising investment in African
  countries may hold
