abstract: This paper examines whether Chinese aid impacts citizens' trust in
  government by matching geocoded data on Chinese aid projects located in
  sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) between 2000 and 2014 to respondents from rounds 3 to
  6 of Afrobarometer survey. Implementing an instrumental variable (IV)
  estimation to control for the potential endogeneity of aid, this paper finds
  robust evidence that Chinese aid reduces trust in government. The decline in
  trust seems to be because the aid projects stimulate poor assessments of
  government performance and perceptions that government officials are involved
  in corrupt activities. Replication analysis reveals that World Bank projects
  are no different and also reduce trust in government. Consequently, these
  findings reignite concerns about the unintended consequences of aid and the
  need to adopt implementation approaches that mitigate unintended adverse
  outcomes.
