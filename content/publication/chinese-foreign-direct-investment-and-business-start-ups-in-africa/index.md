abstract: In recent decades, Chinese FDI has become an integral investment
  source for African countries and has, therefore, engendered studies seeking to
  understand the determinants of these flows. In a quest to identify the factors
  that stimulate these flows, this paper assesses whether the ease of starting a
  business induces Chinese FDI flow to Africa. The analysis is based on panel
  data for 46 African countries between 2004 and 2018. The results from
  fixed-effects estimations suggest that Chinese FDI is attracted by the ease of
  starting a business in African economies. This finding also holds for
  sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and is robust across all estimations. The results
  also provide corroborating evidence that identifies Chinese FDI as market and
  resource-seeking, attracted to large markets and economies with abundant
  natural resources. The findings suggest that improving business regulations
  could be a stimulant for Chinese FDI flow to Africa. In evaluating the nexus
  between Chinese FDI and business start-ups, this paper provides new evidence
  to complement the dated studies on this theme.
