abstract: This paper examines how exposure to Chinese development projects
  shapes economic expectations in Africa. We link AidData's geocoded project
  records to 70,060 Afrobarometer interviews from 2005 to 2023 and identify
  effects using a shift–share instrumental variables design that interacts
  movements in Chinese construction-input costs with pre-sample allocation
  patterns. We find that living within 25 km of an active Chinese project lowers
  the probability that respondents expect national economic conditions to
  improve and, more modestly, reduces optimism about their own living
  conditions. Mechanism tests show that exposure raises perceived
  corruption—especially of national officials—and erodes trust in the
  presidency, parliament, and local councils; higher perceived corruption is
  monotonically associated with lower economic optimism. Results are robust
  across alternative instrument lags, distance thresholds, and spatial-spillover
  controls, and they do not generalize to placebo outcomes or to analogous
  estimates for World Bank projects. The evidence reconciles mixed views of
  Chinese aid by highlighting governance signals as the channel through which
  localized experiences translate into both macro- and micro-oriented
  expectations.
