abstract: We assess the impact of corruption on firm growth using the World Bank
  Enterprise Survey (WBES) data on Nigerian firms for the periods 2006 and 2008.
  We measure corruption as firms’ informal payments to get things done faster
  and bypass due process. Firm growth is measured as sales growth of firms. To
  address endogeneity issues and the possibility of measurement error, we use
  industry averages of firms’ informal payments as an instrument in a Two-Stage
  Least Squares (2SLS) estimation. The results we obtain for both 2006 and 2008
  confirm that informal payments substantially hinder firm growth in Nigeria.
  The results are robust and still hold after controlling for city variation and
  omitting outliers. The findings suggest that in the quest to improve firm
  growth, measures that focus on implementing frameworks that shorten the
  duration required for documentation and other firm-related services provided
  by the government would discourage informal payments and thus, improve firms’
  sales growth.
