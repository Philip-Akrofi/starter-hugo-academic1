abstract: One of a government’s primary responsibilities is to provide public
  goods and services for the benefit of citizens. A government that excels in
  such provision may therefore win favorable evaluations from its citizens.
  However, if external state and non-state actors through foreign aid issuance
  become providers of what citizens expect from their government, citizens may
  doubt their government’s competence. In recent decades, China has become an
  important donor to Africa, providing the continent with several aid projects.
  Consequently, this study examines whether aid from China undermines citizens’
  evaluations of government performance. Geocoded data on Chinese aid projects
  are matched to 4 waves of Afrobarometer survey respondents from 31 sub-Saharan
  African countries. Using an instrumental variable estimation, the findings
  indicate that Chinese aid undermines the evaluation of government performance.
  Testing for the mechanism through which this effect manifests, the results
  suggest Chinese aid engenders corruption perceptions and erodes trust.
