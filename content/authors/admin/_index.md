I am Philip Akrofi Atitianti, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Economics, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, China. My research primarily focuses on foreign aid, international trade, and foreign direct investment, emphasizing the consequences and determinants of these financial flows from China to Africa. I also research the implications on governance quality and poverty in African economies.
